It's late at night on March 3rd, 2020. While I'm putting my son to bed, my husband is downstairs creating this blog, writing this very post. You see, he needs content that might live for a little bit. Something that will at least add to the blank slate that would otherwise be the homepage after he deletes the three sample posts that came with this Jekyll theme.
